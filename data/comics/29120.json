First, Howard Chaykin pulls back the Iron Curtain on one of Captain America's wiliest nemeses—Soviet Russia and her never-ending parade of spies, saboteurs and fifth columnists. Next, it’s 1944 and them sneaky Nazis have managed to crack the secrets of electro-magnetic physics…yeah, that's right: apples may fall down in the free world, but schnitzels are falling up in the skies over a mysterious lab in a Polish forest, thanks to a little help from a nearby forced-labor camp. Sure, we could send in the Marines, but why bother when we've got Captain America?! Plus: Wounded behind enemy lines, Captain America faces one of his greatest challenges yet—\r\nescaping a Nazi POW camp…as Steve Rogers!  Collecting CAPTAIN AMERICA: AMERICA FIRST, OPERATION ZERO POINT and PRISONERS OF DUTY.\r\nRated T  …$19.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3906-5",
