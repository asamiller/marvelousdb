    "description": "Hawkeye is an expert archer with an attitude just as on-target as his aim. His stealth combat experience and his ability to hit any target with any projectile make him a valuable member of the Avengers. However, he refuses to let things get too serious, as he has as many jokes as he does arrows!",
