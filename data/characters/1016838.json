    "description": "White Tiger takes everything very seriously. A constant overachiever, she wants to be better and wants the group to be better. With less flashy powers, she feels like she has to work the hardest. \r\n \r\nA skilled acrobatic fighter with feline senses and claws. Ava wears a small Tiger amulet on her belt that gives her supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nIn the field, she’s constantly frustrated with Spider-Man and his irreverent attitude. But the longer the two fight side by side, the more they will understand one another.",
