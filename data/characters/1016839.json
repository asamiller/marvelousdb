    "description": "Danny is always focused yet relaxed - more Zen-focused than chill surfer dude. But when Danny turns into Iron First, he becomes very rigid with perfect posture. A very Yin/Yang character. \r\n\r\nDanny is THE Danny Rand – the 17-year-old head of the giant Rand Corporation.  His wealth rivals Osborn’s – but you’d never know it from his laid- back attitude. However, as Iron Fist, he takes his powers very seriously. \r\n\r\nWhile Danny and Luke are best friends, Danny has a special respect for Spider-Man, acting as a non-judgmental moral commentator on all of Spider-Man’s actions.
